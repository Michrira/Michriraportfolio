# My Portfolio

## Description 

This is my portfolio for everything that I have done with code so far using everything I have learned in class thus far minus Javascript. The entirety of the page was made using only HTML and CSS. 

Horiseon is a maerking company that provides a wide variety of services. This is their website, which provides more information on the services that they currently provide and describes the benefits for potential clients. Clients can easily navigate trhough the website by clicking on the elements located in the header. 

(This was a homework assignment that I took on to challenge myself as I am learning to code. Through this assignment, I have furthered my understanding of HTML, CSS and learning how to code in general.)
