# My Portfolio
This is the beginning of my portfolio and I plan on coming back here to expand upon it as I get more coding experience under my belt. 

## Description 

This is my portfolio for everything that I have done with code so far using everything I have learned in class thus far minus Javascript. The entirety of the page was made using only HTML and CSS. 

(This was a homework assignment that I took on to challenge myself as I am learning to code. Through this assignment, I have furthered my understanding of HTML, CSS and learning how to code in general.)

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this webiste, you can utilize the navigational links on the top right side of the screen. When clicking a link, it will navigate you to the desired section. Images have alt codes and some have links to webpages, some do not as I don't have an extensive portfolio at this time.

(Please feel free to use this code for studying purposes to further your coding knowledge.)
